			"As part of my master internship, I was awarded a research scholarship from FCT (the Portuguese public agency that supports science, technology and innovation). This enabled me to work independently while having the support of my supervisor. It was a great challenge that came with a lot of freedom, but also with huge responsibilities. The focus of this internship (and my dissertation) was to assess whether web applications were already a viable alternative to native ones in mobile devices. Based on this, I delivered my master thesis, which was a comparative study between web and native applications, you can read it [here](/master_thesis.pdf). I also wrote about several cybersecurity topics, you can read them in my [blog](/blog).",
