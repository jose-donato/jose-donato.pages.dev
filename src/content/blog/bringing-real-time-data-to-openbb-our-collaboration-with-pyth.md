## Embarking on a New Journey: OpenBB Meets Real-Time Data

At OpenBB, we've always been driven by the vision of providing comprehensive and accessible financial data to everyone. From the inception of the OpenBB Terminal, our mission has been clear: to equip users with the tools they need to analyze financial markets effectively. 

However, despite our best efforts to integrate various data sources, we consistently encountered a significant gap: the availability of real-time data feeds. 

This is where our exciting collaboration with [Pyth Network](https://pyth.network/) comes into play, marking a key moment in our journey to enhance our offerings and fulfill our commitment to our users.

## Finding Pyth Network

In the early days, I dedicated my time to adding as many crypto sources to the terminal as possible. Despite this, I always felt something was missing - not just in the crypto section, but across the entire spectrum of data we offered. Real-time feeds were the missing piece. Then, I stumbled upon [Pyth](https://pyth.network/).

From the very first interaction, the folks at Pyth were nothing short of amazing. Their willingness to help and the ease of integration of their product made it obvious to me that we were on the verge of something special. 

Integrating Pyth into our open source [Terminal](https://openbb.co/products/terminal) marked the first time we were able to offer real-time data to our users - a step forward in our quest to democratize financial information.

## Face-to-Face with Innovation: Our Encounter with Pyth

Our partnership took a more tangible form in late 2022, when Didier and I had the pleasure of meeting one of the brilliant minds behind Pyth, Marc. This encounter in Lisbon wasÂ a testament to the potential of our collaboration. It was a rare opportunity to connect, share insights, and discuss the future of our partnership in person. 

Marc kindly gifted us with some of the best merch I have ever used. From several high-quality t-shirts to beautiful hats and even a card pack. ðŸ‘‡

Having the opportunity to meet Marc in person was great. Meeting online is one thing but meeting in person is always different.

## Championing Pyth's Vision

Our journey with Pyth is just getting started. We've already done a successful proof of concept (demo below) to integrate Pyth into the Terminal Pro, and we're optimistic about extending this integration to our Add-in for Excel. The potential applications of Pyth's real-time data within our platform are vast and exciting.

## Pyth Network Retrospective Airdrop program

Our collaboration with Pyth extends beyond just integration. 

As part of our collaboration, OpenBB was selected to receive an allocation of PYTH Tokens through the Pyth Network Retrospective Airdrop program.

We plan to support Pyth as actively as possible, including staking the entire amount received through our collaboration. We believe in participating actively within the Pyth protocol to contribute to its growth and success.

## Elevating Finance with OpenBB and Pyth

The partnership between OpenBB and Pyth represents a significant leap forward in our mission to democratize access to financial data. 

By integrating Pyth's real-time [price feeds](https://pyth.network/price-feeds), we enhanced the capabilities of the OpenBB Terminal and empowered our users with the most accurate and up-to-date information available. 

We are eager to see where this collaboration leads us and remain committed to exploring new ways to bring value to our users and the broader financial community.

Join us in exploring the possibilities that our integration with Pyth offers. Visit [Pyth Network](https://pyth.network) to learn more about their innovative solutions and how they're changing the landscape of financial data.
